# Bike Sharing Usage Analysis â€“ Ford GoBike (Bay Area)

## Context & Objective
This project was completed as part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program.  
The dataset comes from the Ford GoBike bike-sharing system in the San Francisco Bay Area, covering more than 183,000 trips in February 2019.  

The project was structured in two parts:
1. **Exploratory Analysis**: freely explore the dataset to identify patterns and generate insights.  
2. **Explanatory Analysis**: focus on key findings and communicate them effectively through clear, audience-friendly visualizations.  

The main objective was to understand how different user types (Subscribers vs Customers) use the service in terms of trip duration, timing, and day of the week.

## Steps Taken

### 1. Exploratory Analysis
- Explored 183,000+ trips from February 2019.  
- Conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.  
- Visualized:  
  - Distribution of trip durations.  
  - Number of trips by hour of day and day of week.  
  - Differences in behavior between Subscribers (commuters) and Customers (casual riders).  

### 2. Explanatory Analysis
- Selected a key story: commuting vs leisure usage patterns.  
- Designed visualizations showing:  
  - Weekday peaks during commute hours for Subscribers.  
  - Longer trips on weekends, mostly by Customers.  
  - Overall duration differences between the two user groups.  

## Key Findings
- Subscribers (majority of riders) mainly use the system for weekday commuting, with clear peaks during morning and evening rush hours.  
- Customers (occasional riders) take longer trips, especially on weekends, reflecting a leisure-oriented usage.   

## Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook with exploratory analysis (Part 1).  
- Jupyter Notebook with explanatory visualization (Part 2).  
- HTML versions of both notebooks for easier viewing and sharing.
